# Semester-Project-2 | Course Assignment

Noroff Collectibles - a platform where registered users can buy and sell items through bidding. New users receive 1000 credits to start. Non-registered users can browse listings, while only registered users can place bids. Built using cutting-edge technologies to ensure a seamless bidding experience.

## Goal

To take the skills learned over the past three semesters and create an auction website.

## Brief

An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.

When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.
